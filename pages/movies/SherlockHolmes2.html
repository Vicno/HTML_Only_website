    <p>
      Intregue, mistery, chess and a race against time, all while atempting to
      beat a master chess player in it's own game, this is a very complex and
      enjoyable movie for any lover of a good detective work
    </p>
    <p>
      The themes, places, fights both mental and phisical are amaizing and out
      of the ordinary for an explosion and stunt loving audience, it feels fresh
      in many ways.
