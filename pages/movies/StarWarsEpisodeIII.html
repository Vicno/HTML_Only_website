      The best of the Star wars original triologies, it has it all, lightsaber
      duels, heroic sacrifices, lots of lore and a good tragedy, one that the
      jedi would rather not tell.

      For any fan, this is just great, showing the climax of a very complex
      history before it all began in a galaxy far, far away.
