      Another Juggernaught of the strategic genre, it is characterized by a turn
      based gameplay that and a high level of complexity, this one will keep you
      busy for hours uppon hours

    <p>
      The most recent game of the genre I have played so far, and it is complex,
      long, and full of exploits, hard to master but very enjoiable.
