    <p>
      This game has one of the best lightsaber mechanics ever implemented into a
      videogame that allows the player to trully feel like a force user, the
      campaing is amaizing and for a huge Star Wars fan as myself it is just
      perfect.

      All things considered it is a cult clasic, also it has something that no
      other Starwars game after has ever done,
      <strong>true dismemberment!</strong>
